2a_Stop_and_Wait_Protocol
AIM
To write a python program to perform stop and wait protocol

ALGORITHM
Start the program.
Get the frame size from the user
To create the frame based on the user request.
To send frames to server from the client side.
If your frames reach the server it will send ACK signal to client
Stop the Program
PROGRAM
CLIENT:
import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',8000))
s.listen(5)
c,addr=s.accept()
while True:
 i=input("Enter a data: ")
 c.send(i.encode())
 ack=c.recv(1024).decode()
 if ack:
   print(ack)
   continue
 else:
   c.close()
   break
SERVER:
   import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.connect(('localhost',8000))
while True:
 print(s.recv(1024).decode())
 s.send("Acknowledgement Recived".encode())
OUTPUT:
CLIENT:
image

SERVER:
image

RESULT
Thus,python program to perform stop and wait protocol was successfully executed Thus, python program to perform stop and wait protocol was successfully executed.
